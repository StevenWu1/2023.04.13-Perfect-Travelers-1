# 2023.04.13-Perfect-Travelers-1
Crush is helping Marlin, Nemo, and Dory cross the ocean and reach California. Crush loves when there is a "perfect" number of travelers. Nemo doesn't know what that means, but Crush explains that a "perfect" number is one where the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the original number. For example, the number 28 is perfect because 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, but the number 27 is not because 1 + 3 + 9 ≠ 27.
